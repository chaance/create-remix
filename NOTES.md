## Michael's feedback

- ~~Remove template question~~
- ~~Use standard app name instead of random name as default~~
- Lose dependency on remix-dev and nuke remix-dev create
- Ensure --version works for setting remix version
- Warn if --version conflicts with version in package.json (should be "\*")
